# Apixels

A cool tool to turn pixels into ASCII art.

It's quite slow; the kind of work that Apixels does is probably better done by a GPU (yet no GPU acceleration is used), and the code is not
exactly the most efficient way to do things, but it can make cool ASCII art out of images in a variety of colour depths.
